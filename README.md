some good fancy animations ? (idk what technology we gonna use that for? example bellow )

Compose Animations: Built-in tools to fade, slide, or expand items.

Lottie: This is the industry standard for "fancy" animations. Designers create animations in Adobe After Effects, export them as a JSON file, and we play them in the app. It looks perfect and is very fast.


prob sending the data for new recipes.. or new items that dosent exist on the free api we use (OpenFoodFacts)
so json formating  as an array? or an object? idk yet we may doo it as Any?


**WHEN AND IF ITS REALEASED**

Fair 😄 here’s the actual TL;DR:

Yes, it’s legal. Yes, it’s free. Even with ads.

What you can do:

✅ Use the Open Food Facts API in your Android app

✅ Upload/contribute data to them

✅ Download all Greek products and store them in your own database

✅ Later release the app publicly, even with ads

What you must do:

📌 Credit Open Food Facts somewhere in the app (About / footer is fine)

📌 If you reuse their data in your own DB, it must stay open (same license)

📌 If you use their images, also credit them

Nice-to-know:

API = free, no key needed (just a proper User-Agent)

For big data (like all Greek products), use their data dumps, not the API

Personal use / unsigned APK doesn’t matter legally

What you can’t do:

❌ Take their data, close it, and pretend it’s proprietary

❌ Remove attribution

One-line version:

Open Food Facts is open data. Use it, copy it, monetize it — just credit them and keep the data open.

If you want, I can tell you exactly what sentence to put in your app to be 100% safe legally.
